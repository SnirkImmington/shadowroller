* Shadowroller Server

This repository contains the backend code for running the server.

You can run this yourself!
- Designed to run in a container or standalone
- Reads all configuration through ~SR_*~ environment variables
  + Defaults to a dev environment when none are specified
- Scales locally using threads/goroutines but can also scale across multiple instances
- Just needs Redis to work right now
- Runs easily in a development mode alongside the frontend, or on production
- Production uses Let's Encrypt HTTPS certs and CORS

The values used in configuration and deployment for https://snirkimmington.github.io/shadowroller
are intentionally kept secret.
