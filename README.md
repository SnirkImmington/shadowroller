# Shadowroller (https://shadowroller.net/)

Shadowroller is work-in-progress a website that lets you roll lots of d6's and follow Shadowrun's dice rules.

There is a server ([sr-server](https://github.com/SnirkImmington/sr-server)) which runs games for my friends.
This system is not available for the general internet at the moment.
You can run a local version of the server yourself if you'd like - it's easy if you're comfortable with the command line and port forwarding.
